This is my recreation of the Google.com homepage.

This is one part of my coding portfolio from The Odin Project.

Enjoy!

Summary of skills learned so far:

I am now able to use flexbox properties to create and adjust rows and columns, utilize href links to populate a web page, and am able to create a separate CSS style sheet and link it to the original index.html file.
